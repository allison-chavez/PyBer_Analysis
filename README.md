# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the PyBer Analysis Challenge was to create a visualization of the data gathered from Pyber depending on differing factors, such as fare cost, amount of drivers, amount of rides and much more. I was able to use my knowledge of python, pandas, and maplotlib to gather and create data in an understandable format. With the help of Omar I was able to create a data summary and a weekly total fare cost visualization in the form of a multplie-line graph for the company to understand the impact of these differentiating factors on the PyBer ride-sharing usage and accessabilty while looking at different city types. This information will allow PyBer to make changes for the future to progress the company.

## Results
Once completing the analysis one was able to create a visualization of the differences and relations between Pyber data depending on city type.
- Urban cities had the highest percentage of total rides, total drivers, and total fares. 
- Suburban cities had the second highest.
- Rural cities had the least percentage of total rides, total drivers, and total fares.

The causes of this can be noted as:
- the cost of fares being cheaper in Urban vs. Rural areas.
- there are more drivers in Urban areas therefore more accessibilty and cheaper fares.

## Summary
The analysis has provided essential data in order for PyBer to help the disparities that Rural communities face. While Urban cities are succeeding there are reccomendations from the data gathered that can help all city types see similar success.
- Increase the amount of drivers to in suburban and rural communities, therefore there can be more public awareness of PyBer as a community resources.
- Create incentives for drivers in urban cities to make them want to do rides in suburban and rural areas, as well as create more community outreach and incentivess for riders to want to use PyBer more in the lower usage communities.
- Gather more demogrpahic information in order to create a better analysis to see who the company needs to reach out more to or understand the reasons onto why certain demographics are not using the app.
