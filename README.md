# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the PyBer Analysis Challenge was to create a visualization of the data gathered from Pyber depending on differing factors, such as fare cost, amount of drivers, amount of rides, and the cost. With the help of Omar I was able to create a data summary and a line graph for the company to better understand the impact of these differentiating factors on the PyBer ride-sharing usage and accessabilty while looking at different city types.

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer
