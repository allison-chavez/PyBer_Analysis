# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of the PyBer Analysis Challenge was to create a visualization of the data gathered from Pyber depending on differing factors, such as fare cost, amount of drivers, amount of rides and much more. I was able to use my knowledge of python, pandas, and maplotlib to gather and create data in an understandable format. With the help of Omar I was able to create a data summary and a weekly total fare cost visualization in the form of a multplie-line graph for the company to better understand the impact of these differentiating factors on the PyBer ride-sharing usage and accessabilty while looking at different city types. This information will allow PyBer to make changes for the future to progress the company.
